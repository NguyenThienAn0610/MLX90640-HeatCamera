# MLX90640-HeatCamera
This repository consist of the code to read camera data on ESP8266 and a simple Android application to visualize the result.
There are two parts involved in the project:
## Reading code
The readings of the camera are parsed and handled by the ESP8266 micro-controller
## Visualize picture code
All the read data are then transported by UART into an Android device and visulized onto the screen.
